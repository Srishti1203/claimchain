## 🎯 Problem it Solves

Citizens often face:
- Delayed or no responses to civic issues

- No easy way to track issues or view peer reports

**ClaimChain** solves this by:
- Providing a tamper-proof, onchain civic complaint system
- Allowing users to see real-time status and community reports
- Offering an AI assistant (*Saarthi*) for guiding users on schemes, policies, and their rights

## 🧗‍♂️ Challenges I Ran Into

> While building ClaimChain, one major hurdle was integrating real-time data flows between the reporting dashboard and chat assistant UI while keeping the interface sleek and vibrant. Styling large data sets without clutter and making everything responsive took careful planning.   
>  
> Another challenge was designing the dark mode with non-generic styles—avoiding grays and blacks while keeping vibrancy alive. After multiple iterations and using Tailwind’s color palette creatively, the design achieved the desired appeal.  
>  
> Lastly, balancing text-heavy civic content with interactivity led us to integrate scroll-triggered animations using **AOS**, making the UX more fluid and digestible.
